## Project Structure
* `docs/` - Documentation
* `data/` - Data files for each dataset and their READMEs
* `parse/` - Scripts for parsing and manipulating the data
* `exports/` - Exported data files after doing any data manipulation. Use this to keep the original data clean. Export folders should be named by date eg. `mm-dd-yyyy`
